    <h1>Pranav Nair</h1>

    <p>
      I am a Mechanical Engineering graduate whose academic and research interests
      have increasingly converged toward materials science, particularly in
      understanding how materials behave under demanding operating conditions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through research projects in hydrogen embrittlement, additive manufacturing of
      metallic systems, and microstructural characterization, I have developed a
      strong interest in structure–property relationships and the role of processing
      and defects in governing material performance.
    </p>

    <p>
      I currently work as a Battery Design Engineer, which has further shaped my
      interest in energy materials and applied modelling. My long-term goal is to
      pursue research that bridges fundamental materials science with real-world
      energy and engineering applications.
